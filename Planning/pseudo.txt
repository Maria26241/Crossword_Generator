I start by orientating the word with the most connections.  It will be horizontal. 

The boxes are made for each word one by one.  They are not connected, so I will place an input text in each box that is invisible.  Only one letter can go in one box at a time.

The next word will be orientated vertical.

The boxes will be made one by one.  Again, they are not connected, so I will place an input text in each box that is invisible.  Only one letter can go in one box at a time.

The canvas is extended per letter if needed.

A third word is placed vertically.  If the canvas doesn't need to be extended, then it's not extended.  Otherwise, the canvas is extended per letter.

Each word needs A) a coordinate B) coordinates for each of its letters.
A fourth word is placed horizontally.  There are two options.  
A) Check if there is a black mark before placing the word.  
B) Loop through the words to see if there is a matching location at that spot.  

If the letter at that spot matches the letter it is overlapping, then place the word there.  

Otherwise, cancel that placement.  Option B is better.

If a word is side-by-side with another word, cancel that placement.

The remaining words without any connections are placed to the side.
